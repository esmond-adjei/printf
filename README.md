# Welcome to the _printf library!

_printf is a custom implementation of the standard printf function in C. It provides similar functionality as the standard printf, but with additional features and flexibility.

Here are some of the features of _printf:

Custom conversion specifiers: _printf supports additional conversion specifiers beyond the standard ones provided by printf. For example, it can handle a custom specifier 'S' that prints a string, and non-printable characters are printed in the format \x followed by the ASCII code in hexadecimal.
Variable argument list: _printf can accept a variable number of arguments, allowing for more flexibility in formatting output.
Additional flags and length modifiers: _printf supports additional flags and length modifiers beyond the standard ones provided by printf.
Getting Started:

To use _printf in your project, you will need to include the header file "myprint.h" which contains the function prototypes. Then you can call _printf in your code with a format string and any additional arguments as needed.

Here's an example of how to use _printf:

```
#include "myprint.h"

int main(void) {
    _printf("Hello, %s!", "world");
    return 0;
}
```

This will print "Hello, world!" to the standard output.

For more information on the available format specifiers, flags, and length modifiers supported by _printf, please refer to the documentation.

Please note that _printf is not a full replacement for the standard printf function, and may not support all the features or formatting options provided by the standard printf.

We hope you find _printf to be a useful addition to your C programming toolset!
